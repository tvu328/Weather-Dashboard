# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This was made to utilize a server-side API. This was built to retrieve a 5 day weather forecast from various cities. It helps the user plan a trip accordingly to the weather forecast provided. I learned to receive and utilize data from a server-side API and have it properly run in the browsr with my own HTML and CSS to style and assemble the page.

## Installation
One step needed to get this app running is to utilize the OpenWeather API.
